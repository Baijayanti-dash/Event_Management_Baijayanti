                <h2 class="h2">Education of Arijit Singh</h2>
                <p>Arijit Singh attended Raja Vijay Singh High School in his hometown before continuing his education at
                    Shripat Singh College. Arijit subsequently finished his undergraduate studies and received his
                    bachelor's degree. Arijit preferred to pursue singing instead of studying. As a result, he was
                    uninterested in his studies.</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Arijit Singh Singing Practice</h2>
                <p>Arijit's house was filled with lovers of music and talented singers. His mother and grandmother were
                    excellent singers, and his mother was also a skilled tabla player. His maternal uncle was also a
                    tabla player. This musical environment at home influenced him so much so that Arijit decided that he
                    would pursue a profession in music as well. Rajendra Prasad taught Arijit classical music, while
                    Dhirendra Prasad Hazari taught him the art of tabla playing. Birendra Prasad Hazari composed pop
                    music for Arijit.</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Personal Life of Arijit Singh</h2>
                <p>Arijit Singh has proven his talent for singing in India and internationally. Arijit married his
                    childhood friends Koel Roy in 2014. Bengali traditions were followed throughout the wedding. Arijit
                    has gone through a bitter divorce before marrying Koel for the second time. Koel Roy also has a son,
                    and Arijit and Koyal are happily married. Today, whenever Arijit performs on stage, the audience
                    requests that he sing "<strong>Tum Hi Ho</strong>" from <strong>Aashiqui-2.</strong></p>
                <h2 class="h2">Arijit Singh's career start</h2>
                alt="Arijit Singh" />
                <p>Arijit sang the song 'All for 1' on Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's movie album 'High School Musical 2', which
                    earned him his first exposure. In 2010, Arijit began working with 'Pritam Chakraborty.' He was cast
                    in three movies by Pritam: Golmaal 3, Crook, and Action Replay. Arijit made his Bollywood debut in
                    2011 with Mithun's composition '<strong>Phir Mohabbat Karne</strong>' from the film '<strong>Murder
                        2</strong>', which was a major success. Arijit performed this song in 2009, but it was published
                    in 2011.</p>
                <p>Arijit Singh sang the song "<strong>Dua</strong>" for Vishal Shekhar in the film
                    "<strong>Shanghai</strong>" in 2012. Arijit performed the song 'Raabta from the film 'Agent Vinod'
                    in Pritam's composition in 2012, and Pritam sang and published it in four distinct versions from
                    Arijit due to its success. In the same year, Arijit also worked with Pritam in the films Players,
                    Cocktail, and Barfi. This earned Arijit various prizes as well.</p>
                <p>Arijit's career was at its top in the year 2013. Arijit sang one of the most popular songs, 'Tum Hi
                    Ho,' in Mithun's composition for the film 'Aashiqui 2' this year, and it became his biggest success.
                    This love song was well-received, earning Arijit several honors and launching him to popularity as a
                    playback singer. 'Jeet Ganguly' composed the music for this film, with whom Arijit has collaborated
                    on other songs. Jeet was looking for a new voice for this film, and after hearing Arijit's song
                    'Dua' on YouTube, he decided to cast him in 'Aashiqui 2'. Arijit worked with Pritam in Karan Johar's
                    film 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' in 2013, singing practically all of the film's songs. Arijit was also
                    named music producer for the film's song 'Balam Pichkari.' According to Arijit, this was a critical
                    period in his career, as it aided him in his development as a musician. He has sung various songs in
                    different films such as Phata Poster Nikla Hero, R. Rajkumar, Chennai Express, Boss, Jackpot,
                    Goliyon Ki Rasleela 'Ram Leela,' and Mickey Virus this year.</p>
                <p>Arijit collaborated with prominent music directors like Sajid-Wajid and A.R Rahman in 2014. After
                    that, he worked with music directors like Amit Trivedi, Sharib-Toshi, Vishal Bhardwaj, Sachin Jigar,
                    Tony Kakkar, and Palash Muchhal. Every small and big filmmaker wanted Arijit to sing a song in their
                    film at this time since everyone felt that one song might make their entire picture a smash.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">Controversy</h2>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>Arijit Singh was arrested in 2013 after becoming enraged during an interview with a journalist.
                    </li>
                    <li>Arijit Singh said in 2015 that gangster Ravi Pujari was threatening him and demanding Rs 5
                        crore, but he did not register an FIR.</li>
                    <li>According to reports, Arijit and Salman Khan had a heated argument in 2016. Arijit is believed
                        to have told Salman something sideways during an award ceremony, following which Salman became
                        so enraged with him that he never saw him again. Arijit also recorded a song for Salman's film
                        Sultan, and the latter, unforgiving of Arijit, had it removed. Arijit admitted his mistake and
                        apologized to Salman several times via social media, but he did not respond to Salman on the
                        matter.</li>
                    <li>Arijit was set to judge a Star Plus singing competition called 'Raw Star,' which had previously
                        been judged by Honey Singh. The producers planned to take Honey and Arijit this time, but these
                        singers didn't get along well; thus, the program was postponed. Arijit's lights are declining
                        due to his deteriorating relationship with Salman, and he is being refused everywhere.</li>
